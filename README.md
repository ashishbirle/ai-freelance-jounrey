Day 3 Explored the Hugging Face Transformers library and tried out several NLP pipelines. These models were incredibly easy to run and gave impressive results with just a few lines of code. huggingface_intro.ipynb serves as a starting point for real-world applications like chatbots, text classifiers, and smart assistants.
